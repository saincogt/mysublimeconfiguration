# Sancho's ST3 configuration backup repository

This repository is the backup of the `User` folder, all the global settings, keybindings, packages settings etc are saved in it.

Instruction for using the config on an other computer:

1. Remove the User folder of the fresh install (usually its located at `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User`)
2. Clone your backup (only the User folder)
3. Install Package Control
4. Restart Sublime Text

Done.
